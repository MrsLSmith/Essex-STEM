At the Green Up Day table, we'll provide you with Green Up Day bags and gloves, and help you adopt a stretch of roadway to green up. Volunteers helping to green up Montpelier can leave Green Up Day bags curbside within city limits. If you’re not able to make it to the Farmer’s Market on the morning of Green Up Day, you can still volunteer. You can pick up Green Up Day bags in advance from the Montpelier City Clerk’s Office. To help coordinate Montpelier’s Green up Day efforts, we are using an online mapping tool. To claim a stretch of road, park, or parking lot to green up using the online tool, visit: www.montpelieralive.org/greenupmap. Using the pop-out box that appears on the screen under the leaf icon, you can claim the roadway or Green Up Day project you've selected in the map by inputting your name and indicating that you've \"adopted\" it."
